 * LeetCode Problem 11. Container With Most Water
 * Difficulty: Medium
 *
 * Problem Statement:
 * You are given an integer array height of length n.
 * There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).
 * Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.
 * Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.
 * Notice that you may not slant the container.
