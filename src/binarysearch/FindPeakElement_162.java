/*
 * LeetCode Problem 162: Find Peak Element
 * Difficulty: Medium
 *
 * Problem Statement:
 * A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.
 * Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index.
 * If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.
 * You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -∞.
 *  In other words, an element is always
 * considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.
 * You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.
